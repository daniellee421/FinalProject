    <h1>The College Powerhouses</h1>
    <p>The NBA, also know as the National Basketball Association, is a professional basketball league in North America. For any basketball player, they yearn and dream to step foot onto the court of the best basketball league in the world. From dazzling spin moves from Allen Iverson to hypnotic dribbling of Kyrie Irving, many put in countless hours of blood, sweat, and tears just to make the stage. However, most fail to. Because there are so many people who play basketball in the world, many talented players fail to make it to the league of 450 players because they lack of notice and recognition by recruits. But some do, through college basketball.</p>
    <h2> Which College Send the Most Amount of Players to the NBA? </h2>

Thousands pay a hefty deal to stand amongst the crowds and cheer on their favorite team, while millions watch at home. Players who shine receive countless supporters and catch the eye of NBA recruiters. This lead to 85.5% of the entire NBA constituting players that played college basketball. But just like how there are better teams in the NBA, there are better college teams as well.</p>
